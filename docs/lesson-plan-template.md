# Universal Lesson Plan Template

This document provides a suggested learning progression and lesson schema template. While the example below focuses on language learning, the same structure can be adapted for any workshop on the Open Learn platform.

## Overview

A complete curriculum typically consists of **30-50 lessons** organized into progressive difficulty levels. The example below shows a language learning curriculum where **Phase 1 focuses heavily on verbs** - the backbone of language - while introducing topical vocabulary through verb usage contexts.

## Learning Philosophy: Verbs First (Language Example)

**Why verbs first?**
- Verbs are the most frequently used words in any language
- They provide sentence structure and meaning
- Conjugation patterns are foundational
- Topics (weather, food, animals) serve as **vocabulary contexts** for verb learning

**Language Learning Phase 1 Goal**: Cover the **50 most common verbs** with complete conjugation examples, simultaneously building vocabulary across multiple topics.

## Best Practices

### 1. Progressive Difficulty
- Build on previously learned vocabulary and grammar
- Reference earlier lessons when introducing related concepts
- Don't introduce too many new concepts in one lesson

### 2. Practical Examples
- Use real-world, practical sentences
- Include variety: statements, questions, negatives
- Show different persons (I, you, he/she, we, they)

### 3. Cultural Relevance
- Include culturally appropriate examples
- Explain differences in usage between languages
- Note false friends and common mistakes

### 4. Related Items (rel)
- First element is always the unique identifier (the word in target language)
- Include translations
- Add context: part of speech, usage notes, related words
- Consistent IDs allow tracking across lessons

### 5. Labels
- Use for categorization: grammar concepts, tenses, moods
- Keep labels consistent across lessons
- Useful for: Gerund, Infinitive, Past, Future, Conditional, Subjunctive, Passive, etc.

### 6. Explanations
- Use markdown for formatting
- Include conjugation tables when relevant
- Explain exceptions and irregular forms
- Provide usage context and examples

## Language-Specific Considerations

### For Gendered Languages (German, French, Spanish, etc.)
- Always include gender markers in `rel` items
- Example: `["cat", "der Kater (m) / die Katze (f)", "noun"]`

### For Tonal Languages (Mandarin, Vietnamese, etc.)
- Include tone markers in examples
- Note tone changes in compounds

### For Languages with Cases (German, Russian, etc.)
- Show different cases in examples
- Explain case usage in explanations

### For Languages with Formality Levels (Japanese, Korean, etc.)
- Indicate formality level in labels
- Include both formal and informal examples

### For Languages with Scripts (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.)
- Ensure proper right-to-left text handling
- Include transliteration if helpful

## Vocabulary Thresholds

**Verb-focused progression**:
- **By Lesson 15** (Phase 1): 50 verbs + 400-600 vocabulary words
- **By Lesson 25** (Phase 2): 50 verbs (all tenses) + 800-1000 words
- **By Lesson 35** (Phase 3): 50 verbs (all forms) + 1200-1500 words
- **By Lesson 45** (Phase 4): 50+ verbs + 2500-3000 words (topic expansion)
- **By Lesson 50** (Phase 5): 60-70 verbs + 3000-3500 words

**Priority**: Master core verbs completely before expanding vocabulary breadth

## Review Cycles

- **Every 5 lessons**: Mini review
- **Every 10 lessons**: Comprehensive review
- **Lesson 25**: Mid-point assessment
- **Lesson 50**: Final mastery review

## Customization for Specific Languages

When creating lessons for a new language pair:

1. Research the language's specific challenges
2. Adapt lesson order based on grammatical complexity
3. Add language-specific lessons (e.g., German cases, French articles)
4. Consider cultural context and authentic usage
5. Include false friends and common mistakes for that language pair

## Getting Started

To create a new lesson:

1. Choose your lesson number from the progression above
2. Copy the YAML template structure
3. Fill in sections with 4-6 main concepts
4. Add 3-5 examples per section
5. Include explanations with key grammar points
6. Add related vocabulary items
7. Test the lesson flow and difficulty
