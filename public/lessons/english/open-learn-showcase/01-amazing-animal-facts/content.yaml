  - title: "Ocean Creatures"
    video: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOjkHiGHSd8"
    explanation: |
      The ocean covers **71%** of Earth's surface, and we've explored less than 5% of it.
      Here are some incredible facts about the creatures living down there.

      > This section demonstrates: video embeds, markdown explanations, Q&A examples, and related items.
    examples:
      - q: "How many hearts does an octopus have?"
        a: "Three — two pump blood to the gills, one pumps it to the rest of the body."
        labels: ["Anatomy"]
        rel:
          - ["octopus", "8 arms, 3 hearts, blue blood"]
          - ["cephalopod", "class of mollusks including octopus and squid"]

      - q: "What animal can survive being frozen solid?"
        a: "The wood frog — it can survive with 65% of its body water frozen."
        labels: ["Survival"]
        rel:
          - ["wood frog", "Rana sylvatica, found in North America"]
          - ["cryoprotectant", "natural antifreeze produced by the frog's liver"]

      - q: "How long can a dolphin stay awake?"
        a: "Indefinitely — dolphins sleep with one half of their brain at a time."
        labels: ["Sleep", "Brain"]
        rel:
          - ["unihemispheric sleep", "sleeping with one brain hemisphere at a time"]
          - ["dolphin", "highly intelligent marine mammal"]

      - q: "What color is a lobster's blood?"
        a: "Clear — but it turns blue when exposed to oxygen (it contains copper, not iron)."
        labels: ["Anatomy"]
        rel:
          - ["hemocyanin", "copper-based oxygen transport protein"]
          - ["lobster", "crustacean with copper-based blood"]

  - title: "Insects & Tiny Creatures"
    explanation: |
      Insects make up about **80%** of all known animal species.
      Some of their abilities put science fiction to shame.
    examples:
      - q: "How far can a flea jump relative to its body size?"
        a: "A flea can jump 150 times its own body length — like a human jumping over a 75-story building."
        labels: ["Strength"]
        rel:
          - ["flea", "tiny parasitic insect, incredible jumper"]
          - ["resilin", "elastic protein in flea legs enabling jumps"]

      - q: "How many lenses does a dragonfly's eye have?"
        a: "About 30,000 — giving it nearly 360-degree vision."
        labels: ["Vision"]
        rel:
          - ["compound eye", "eye made of thousands of individual lenses"]
          - ["dragonfly", "ancient insect, virtually unchanged for 300 million years"]

      - q: "Can a cockroach live without its head?"
        a: "Yes, for about a week — it eventually dies of thirst because it can't drink."
        labels: ["Survival"]
        rel:
          - ["cockroach", "one of the most resilient insects on Earth"]
          - ["open circulatory system", "blood not confined to vessels, allows headless survival"]

      - q: "What is the strongest animal relative to its size?"
        a: "The dung beetle — it can pull 1,141 times its own body weight."
        labels: ["Strength"]
        rel:
          - ["dung beetle", "rolls balls of dung, incredibly strong"]
          - ["Onthophagus taurus", "species of horned dung beetle, strongest animal"]

  - title: "Mammals Gone Wild"
    explanation: |
      Even the animals we think we know well have some _seriously weird_ hidden talents.
    examples:
      - q: "How long does a sloth take to digest a meal?"
        a: "Up to 30 days — they have the slowest digestion of any mammal."
        labels: ["Digestion"]
        rel:
          - ["sloth", "slowest mammal, sleeps 15-20 hours per day"]

      - q: "What is a group of flamingos called?"

          - ["flamingo", "pink from carotenoid pigments in their diet"]

      - q: "Can cows have best friends?"
        a: "Yes — studies show cows have best friends and get stressed when separated."
        labels: ["Behavior"]
        rel:

      - q: "How far away can a wolf howl be heard?"
