    explanation: |
      **Open Learn** is a free, open-source platform for learning anything — languages, science, trivia, you name it.

      It's:
      - **Free** — no ads, no subscriptions, no tracking
      - **Open** — anyone can create and share workshops
      - **Extensible** — load content from URLs, IPFS, or your own server
      - **Offline-friendly** — runs as a static site, no backend needed

      We'd love to hear what you think. Your answers are saved in your browser for you to revisit.
      If you'd like to share them with us, enable "Share Answers with Coach" in Settings.
