  iOS Lock Screen Support: The current implementation uses Web Speech API directly, which doesn't provide true background audio on iOS. For full iOS
  lock screen support with media controls, you would need to:
  - Use MediaRecorder API to capture Web Speech API output as blobs
  - Feed those blobs to an <audio> element
  - Set proper MediaSession API metadata

  This is a more complex implementation that requires additional testing on iOS devices. The current implementation will work on desktop and will read
  audio on mobile, but may pause when the screen locks.
